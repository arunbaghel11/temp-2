Development Process------>

Requirement Analysis: Understanding the project requirements and goals, including features like authentication, movie browsing, searching, and user list management.

Technology Selection: Choosing appropriate technologies based on project requirements, such as React for frontend development, Redux for state management, styled-components for styling, and Firebase for authentication and database.

Component Design: Breaking down the application into reusable components for better organization and maintenance.
Implementation: Writing code for each component, ensuring functionality and responsiveness. Implementing features like authentication, fetching movie data, searching, and user list management.


Testing: Testing each component individually and then integration testing to ensure seamless interaction between components.


Deployment: Deploying the application on a hosting platform like Netlify or Vercel for public access.
the website is deployed here :"https://6651848330bad9da64e61796--tiny-kelpie-b3e15c.netlify.app/"



Technologies Used------>

React: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
React Router: For routing and navigation within the application.
Redux Toolkit: State management library for managing application state.
Axios: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
Firebase: Authentication service for user authentication and Firestore for database storage.
Styled-components: CSS-in-JS library for styling React components.
TMDB API: The Movie Database API for fetching movie data.




Assumptions Made---->

Authentication: Assuming Firebase is used for user authentication and data storage.
Movie Data: Assuming the TMDB API is used to fetch movie data.
Styling: Using styled-components for styling components assuming a preference for CSS-in-JS approach.
Routing: Using React Router for navigation assuming multiple pages/routes are required for different functionalities.


Note: This README provides a high-level overview of the development process, technologies used, and assumptions made. Detailed implementation and code explanations can be found in the respective files of the project.





Important Note---->
TMDB API and Website---->
The TMDB API and website were not running on my network. If the link does not work or you are unable to see the movie cards and details on the page, it is advised to refresh or install a VPN.
On phone, use SuperVPN and on laptop/PC, use TurboVPN.
The API fetches the results only when the VPN is enabled as the TMDB website is down. It is a humble request to enable VPN for the website to be fully functional.
and sorry for the inconvenience caused
